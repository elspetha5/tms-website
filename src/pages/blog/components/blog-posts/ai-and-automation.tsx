      <h2>Key AI and Automation Advancements Reshaping MDM in 2025</h2>
      <h3>Predictive Analytics and Enhanced Security</h3>
      <p>
        The most significant transformation in MDM has occurred in security
        operations. Traditional reactive security measures have given way to
        predictive models that anticipate threats before they materialize:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>AI-Driven Threat Intelligence</strong>: Modern MDM solutions
            now utilize machine learning algorithms that analyze patterns across
            millions of devices to identify potential security vulnerabilities
            before they can be exploited. These systems continuously learn from
            new attack vectors, becoming more sophisticated with each attempted
            breach.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Behavioral Anomaly Detection</strong>: AI systems now
            establish baseline device and user behaviors, immediately flagging
            unusual activities that might indicate compromised credentials or
            malicious access attempts. This has reduced security incident
            response times by up to 60% compared to traditional methods.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Automated Remediation</strong>: When threats are detected,
            AI systems can automatically implement predefined security
            protocols—quarantining devices, revoking access credentials, or
            deploying security patches without human intervention.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
